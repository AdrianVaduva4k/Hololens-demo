# Hololens2-demo
This is supposed to be a Mixed Reality/AR demo for SCADA Systems.

The demo involves a (currently 3D environment) network switch and overlays to control it through Hololens 2 input.

Code is extremely messy since I currently do not follow a certain design pattern but more of a trial and error approach. This is a demo so components are supposed to react interesting and not necessarily beneficial.
